# Baqla: Modify the program not the data

Baqla is a micro services orchestration framework where the data evolution can coexist with an application development.
In a traditional way developers build an application first and manage the data it generates later.

With Baqla it is possible to evolve both sides at the same time. The focus is changing from the application to the data.
Applications could be built "around" the data making it the center of a system design and implementation.

The framework is designed with developers in mind allowing easy integration with existing code base.
